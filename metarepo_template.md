## Code reference
References for each minted software release for all code involved.  

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub username.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.

## Reproduce my experiment
Fill in detailed info here or link to other documentation to thoroughly walkthrough how to use the contents of this repository to reproduce your experiment. Below is an example.


1. Install the software components required to conduct the experiment from [contributing modeling software](#contributing-modeling-software)
2. Download and install the supporting [input data](#input-data) required to conduct the experiment
3. Run the following scripts in the `workflow` directory to re-create this experiment:

| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `step_one.py` | Script to run the first part of my experiment | `python3 step_one.py -f /path/to/inputdata/file_one.csv` |
| `step_two.py` | Script to run the second part of my experiment | `python3 step_two.py -o /path/to/my/outputdir` |

4. Download and unzip the [output data](#output-data) from my experiment 
5. Run the following scripts in the `workflow` directory to compare my outputs to those from the publication

| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compare.py` | Script to compare my outputs to the original | `python3 compare.py --orig /path/to/original/data.csv --new /path/to/new/data.csv` |

## Reproduce my figures
Use the scripts found in the `figures` directory to reproduce the figures used in this publication.

| Figure Number(s) | Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1, 2 | `generate_plot.py` | Description of figure, ie. "Plots the difference between our two scenarios" | `python3 generate_plot.py -input /path/to/inputs -output /path/to/outuptdir` |
| 3 | `generate_figure.py` | Description of figure, ie. "Shows how the mean and peak differences are calculated" | `python3 generate_figure.py -input /path/to/inputs -output /path/to/outuptdir` |
