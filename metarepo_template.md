## Abstract
In this paper the authors develop a long-term global energy-economic model which is capable of assessing alternative energy evolutions over periods of up to 100 years. The authors have sought to construct the model so that it can perform its assigned task with as simple a modelling system as possible. The model structure is fully documented and a brief summary of results is given.

## Code reference
References for each minted software release for all code involved.  

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub user name.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.
